    {
      "question": "What is ARR?",
      "answer": "ARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue - the predictable annual revenue from subscription-based customers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the prediction algorithm work?",
      "answer": "Our Enhanced Tier-Based Prediction System uses a 3-stage approach: 1) Tier-based input (minimal required data), 2) Intelligent feature completion (inferring missing features from similar companies), 3) LightGBM modeling with 152+ engineered features including lag features, rolling windows, and SaaS-specific metrics like Magic Number and Burn Multiple."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is intelligent feature completion?",
      "answer": "When you provide minimal data (like just ARR and headcount), our system finds similar companies from our database of 500+ VC-backed companies, then uses their median values to intelligently fill in missing features like gross margin, sales & marketing spend, etc. This is done using logarithmic similarity matching and weighted median inference."
    },
    {
      "question": "What features are required for a prediction?",
      "answer": "Tier 1 (Required): Q1-Q4 ARR, Headcount, Sector. Tier 2 (Optional): Gross Margin, Sales & Marketing, Cash Burn, Churn Rate, Customers, Expansion Rate. The system intelligently infers missing Tier 2 features from similar companies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How accurate are the predictions?",
      "answer": "The model achieves an R² score of 0.7966 (79.66%) with ±10% confidence intervals on all predictions. This represents significant improvement through advanced feature engineering and intelligent feature completion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Magic Number and how is it calculated?",
      "answer": "Magic Number = Net New ARR ÷ Sales & Marketing Spend (previous quarter). It measures sales efficiency: >1.0 is excellent, 0.5-1.0 is good, <0.5 needs improvement."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Burn Multiple?",
      "answer": "Burn Multiple = |Cash Burn| ÷ Net New ARR. It measures capital efficiency - how much cash you burn to generate $1 of new ARR. Lower is better."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do confidence intervals work?",
      "answer": "All predictions include ±10% uncertainty bands. For example, if we predict $2M ARR, the range would be $1.8M - $2.2M. This accounts for model uncertainty and business volatility."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use this for companies outside the VC space?",
      "answer": "The model is trained on 500+ VC-backed companies. While it may work for other SaaS companies, predictions for companies outside this distribution may be less reliable."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I upload data?",
      "answer": "You can upload a CSV file using the /predict_csv endpoint, or use the tier-based system by providing just the essential metrics (ARR, headcount, sector) through the /tier_based_forecast endpoint."
    },
    {
      "question": "What model is used?",
      "answer": "Venture Prophet uses an Enhanced Tier-Based Prediction System with Intelligent Feature Completion. The core model is LightGBM (Gradient Boosted Trees) trained on 5,085+ records from 500+ VC-backed companies. The system operates in 3 stages: 1) Tier-based input (minimal required data), 2) Intelligent feature completion (inferring missing features from similar companies using logarithmic similarity matching), 3) LightGBM modeling with 152+ engineered features.
